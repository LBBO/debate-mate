# Debate Mate

A specialized timer for debates (currently limited to BP and OPD).

## Features

- ⏳ Choose the type of speech you'd like to moderate (7 minutes for BP or regular OPD, 3.5 minutes for OPD free speeches)
- 🔔 Different sounds alert you to the end or beginning of protected time, the end of regular time, and the end of the grace period
- ⏩ If a speech ends early, the timer switches over to show the remaining preparation time
- 🤨 Test or demonstrate the sounds and the UI via the "Demo" speech (about 10 seconds)
- 🔆 Your phone screen is kept from locking (can be checked via the icon in the bottom-right corner)

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
